## ‚òÄÔ∏è Introduction

Employee attrition, or the rate at which employees leave a company, is a critical aspect of workforce management that can have a significant impact on a business's success. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a powerful tool for understanding the factors that contribute to employee attrition and developing effective strategies to mitigate it. In this project, we use Python to conduct an EDA of employee attrition data and gain insights into the factors that contribute to employee turnover. Through our analysis, we aim to provide actionable recommendations for businesses to reduce their employee attrition rates and improve their overall performance.
